"Preacher aims to automate tests using real backends: neither mocks or "
"sandboxes. Supporting both automation and real backends has been "
"challenging."

"Flexible validation: Real backends causes fuzzy behavior. Matcher-based "
"validation allow fuzziness caused by real backends."

"CI integration: CI tools are basic automation ways. CLI and YAML based "
"test scenarios are suitable for CI."

"Simple GET requests: Testing with real backends often targets data "
"fetching rather than HTTP interactions such as authorization. Development"
" for complex HTTP interactions is less priored."

"`Postman <https://www.getpostman.com/>`_ gives rich insights on Web APIs."

"`Tavern <https://tavern.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is more suitable for"
" testing HTTP interactions. It seems to be more suitable for testing "
"simple systems or testing without real backends than Preacher because of "
"simple validators."
